			<div class="image-info">
				<h2>Wells Town</h2>
				<img src="images/wells-town.jpg" class="image" width="400"
					height="300" alt=	"[ Wells town ]" />
				<p>Wells is a traditional seaside town, charming and picturesque with lots 
					of narrow lanes and interesting shops to explore.  There is something to be 
					seen at all times of the year.  During the winter thousands of Pink foot 
					geese gather around the coast, leaving the fields inland to roost on the 
					marshes overnight, a spectacular sight. Curlews, sandpipers, egrets can 
					also be seen feeding in the channel and marshes.  Wells is a drying harbour 
					so the fishing boats wait for high tide to go out and bring back their catch 
					of lobster and crabs</p>

				<h2>Wells Harbour</h2>
				<img src="images/harbour.jpg" class="image" width="400"
					height="300" alt=	"[ The harbour ]" />
				<p>The summer brings with it crabbing from the quayside (local name gillying), 
					the harbour filled with yachts of all shapes and sizes, the fish caravan on 
					the quayside selling local crabs and lobsters.  The traditional Wells carnival
					is held for one week around the first week in August.  Various events for adults
					and children are held around the town including live music, BBQ’s, 
					competitions and workshops finishing with the carnival procession winding its way around the 
					town.</p>

				<h2>The Sea Wall</h2>
				<img src="images/walkway.jpg" class="image" width="400" 
					height="300" alt=	"[ The walkway from Wells quay to the beach ]" />
				<p>From the quayside the sea wall runs alongside the channel to the lifeboat 
				station and beach, with miles of golden sand and colourful beach huts.
				The Lifeboat House on the beach is often open to visitors, the nearby 
				Coastwatch station is open every day and welcomes visitors with one of the 
				best views of Wells beach.</p>
