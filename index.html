				<h2>The House</h2>

				<p>The Merchantâ€™s House, part of which was built in the 15th century, is one of 
				the oldest houses in Wells. It also has later additions added in the 1700's.
			  The house is close to the quayside and bustling harbour 
				and a few minutes walk to the town centre, pubs and restaurants.  The main beach 
				with its colourful beach huts and miles of golden sands is but a short walk along 
				the sea wall towards the lifeboat station or a short drive down Beach Road to the 
				car park.  We have a courtyard at the rear of the house with parking throughout the year. The dining room where breakfast is served was originally a Butchers Shop 
				and is 	available for guests to use as a sitting room, there are lots of books 
				to browse through as well as local information and maps showing a huge selection 
				of walks in and around the Wells area.</p>

			<h2>Courtyard</h2>

					<p>A nice place to relax after a busy day.			
			    The Merchants House is ideal for an overnight stop as Wells is in the centre of the 
				  North Norfolk Coastal Path.  We can arrange for the reception and onward transportation
				  of luggage.  Bicycles can be stored safely overnight.  We welcome bird watchers and can 
				  accommodate early starts. </p>
